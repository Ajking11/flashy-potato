USB Transfer System - Enhanced Process Flow
Step 1: Preparation Phase

Start USB Transfer
Validate Local Software File

If file not found → Show Error: File Missing → END (Error)
If file exists → Progress: 5% - File Validated


Step 2: USB Detection & Cleanup Phase

Use SAF File Picker (Android 10+ Storage Access Framework)
User Selects Destination

If cancelled → Transfer Cancelled → END (Cancelled)
If selected → Scan USB Contents for Existing Files


Scan USB Contents

If existing files found → Show File List with Confirmation Dialog
    
    User Confirmation Required:
    "Found X existing files. Do you want to delete them?"
    - List all files to be deleted
    - "Confirm & Continue" button
    - "Cancel & Choose Different Location" button
    
    If user cancels → Return to destination selection
    If user confirms → Delete Existing Files
    
    If deletion fails → Show Cleanup Error → END (Error)
    If deletion succeeds → Progress: 15% - Destination Set


If no files found → Progress: 15% - Destination Set


Step 3: Transfer Phase with Enhanced UX
ZIP Verification

Progress: 25% - Preparing ZIP Verification
Initialize Time Estimation (based on file size)
Calculate ZIP SHA256 Hash
Compare with Stored Hash

Check for Cancellation (user can abort at any time)

If hash mismatch → Show File Integrity Error → END (Error)
If hash match → Progress: 35% - ZIP Verified


Content Extraction & Transfer with Real-time Progress

Extract ZIP Contents with Granular Progress (75% → 95%)
Create Directory Structure
Progress: 55% - Structure Created

For each file being extracted:
    Check for Cancellation
    Update Progress: 75% + (20% × files_extracted/total_files)
    Update Time Estimate
    Display: "Extracting: filename.ext (X/Y files)"

Move Extracted Content to USB
Progress: 75% - 95% (granular updates during extraction)

Error Recovery with Multiple Fallbacks

Content Move Successful?

If failed → Try Fallback Method 1 (SAF or Direct Write)

If Fallback 1 fails → Try Fallback Method 2 (Force Direct Write)

If Fallback 2 fails → Show User-Friendly Error → END (Error)
If Fallback 2 succeeds → Progress: 100% - Success


If Fallback 1 succeeds → Progress: 100% - Success


If successful → Progress: 100% - Success

Clear Time Estimation
Show Success Message
END (Success)


Enhanced UX Features Implemented

Cancellation Support:
- Users can cancel transfer at any stage (except during critical file operations)
- Graceful cancellation with proper state cleanup
- Cancel button available throughout process

User Confirmation for File Deletion:
- Pre-transfer scanning of destination directory
- Display list of files that will be deleted
- User must explicitly confirm deletion before proceeding
- Option to choose different destination if files exist

Estimated Time Remaining:
- Dynamic time calculation based on file size and current progress
- Human-readable format: "2m 30s remaining", "45s remaining"
- Updates in real-time during transfer operations
- Cleared upon completion

Real-time Progress Granularity:
- Smooth progress updates from 75% to 95% during ZIP extraction
- Individual file extraction progress display
- No large progress jumps - granular updates for better UX
- Progress tied to actual file operations

Android 10+ SAF Compatibility: Uses Storage Access Framework for secure file access
Pre-transfer Cleanup: User-confirmed removal of existing files from destination
SHA256 Verification: Validates ZIP file integrity before extraction
ZIP Extraction: Automatically extracts and structures content with real-time feedback
Progress Tracking: Enhanced 7-phase progress system with granular updates
Error Recovery: Multiple fallback methods for failed transfers
User-friendly Error Messages: Clear error reporting at each potential failure point

Enhanced Progress Phases
Phase   Percentage      Description                          Features
1       5%             File Validated                       Initial validation
2       15%            Destination Set                      After cleanup confirmation
3       25%            Preparing ZIP Verification          Time estimation begins
4       35%            ZIP Verified                        Cancellation checkpoints
5       55%            Structure Created                   Pre-extraction setup
6       75% → 95%      Content Moved (Granular)           Real-time file extraction progress
7       100%           Success                             Time estimation cleared

Cancellation Points:
- During file reading (Step 3)
- During ZIP verification (Step 4) 
- Before extraction (Step 5)
- During each file extraction (Step 6)
- During fallback attempts

User Interaction Points:
- File deletion confirmation dialog (Step 2)
- Cancel transfer button (throughout process)
- Destination selection retry (if deletion declined)
- Real-time progress and time estimates (Steps 3-6)
